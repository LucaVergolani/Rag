Less than a stone's throw from the Arena, in this small and welcoming tavern, every day the love for the typical Veronese cuisine and for the products of the Veronese territory is brought to the table, there is no lack of a touch of innovation in the service: computerized menu and online booking. From the classic gnocchi with horse pastissada which goes well with a Ripasso della Valpolicella, to the bigoli with cacio pepe and pearà with a glass of Lessini Durello, every dish is a story, every story is told through a dish. The tavern's cellar, with more than one hundred references from within the province and from across the border, will not leave you empty-handed. Romei and Juliet from everywhere, if you are in Verona, stop by Hosteria because: Punto Rosa makes the difference.

226,Tibetan Bridge (Torri del Benaco),"The Tibetan bridge of Torri del Benaco is the ideal destination for a family trip. It can be reached with a not too demanding hike and special equipment is not necessary, but trekking shoes are recommended. The bridge was built to join the CAI paths 38 and 39, therefore, it allows you to go from Malcesine to Garda without having to go up to San Zeno di Montagna.
Inaugurated in 2019, it is 34 meters long and reaches a height of 45 meters from the valley floor. The bridge can also be crossed by bike, but it must be carried by hand.
Access is free.
How to get
The nearest Modena-Brennero motorway exit is Affi. From the Gardesana road (SR249) then follow the signs for Torri del Benaco and, subsequently, for the locality of Crero.
