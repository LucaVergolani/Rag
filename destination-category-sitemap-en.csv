6,Bardolino,"On the eastern Riviera of Lake Garda, 30 km from Verona, within an enchanting setting, stands a fascinating village which gives its name to the well-known wine. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the town suffered the Lombard, Gothic, Visigothic and Frankish invasions, which is why, towards the end of the 9th century, fortified walls and castles were built with a defense function. Today, between hills and lake, this ancient fishing village is one of the main tourist destinations frequented in summer but also pleasant during winter, especially for Sunday walks.

Verona, city of art, culture, but not only... good food with ancient flavors thanks to recipes handed down from generation to generation and typical local wine, renowned throughout the world for its goodness and peculiarity.
