5,5 TYPICAL VERONA DISHES NOT TO BE MISSED,"One of the many ways to discover a place is to eat typical local dishes. Experiencing a place, understanding it, discovering it also means trying the flavors that characterize it and which are loved so much by the locals. This is why we absolutely want to recommend 5 typical dishes of the Veronese tradition to taste during your visit to Verona.

1- Amarone risotto

Thanks to its delicious flavour, this risotto cooked with the fine Valpolicella wine is one of the favorite dishes of residents and visitors to the city. It is prepared with ingredients that come exclusively from the Veronese area: Vialone Nano rice, Amarone della Valpolicella and grated Monte Veronese cheese.

2 – Tasty risotto

A typical dish of Veronese and Veneto cuisine, this risotto is made of minced, salted and peppered pork. The meaning of the word ""tastasal"" is precisely ""to taste the salt"" in Venetian dialect, and in fact this recipe was prepared to check that the meat used for sausages and salami was properly salted. Very popular in the kitchens of the Veronese, there are various versions, all equally delicious.

3 – Lesso and Pearà

Among the typical dishes of Verona, one of the best known is Lesso con la Pearà, that is, boiled meat and vegetables served with a puree of grated bread flavored with plenty of pepper. It seems like a humble and poor dish but in reality there is a royal story behind it... It is said that the first to cook the iconic sauce was the court chef of Alboin, king of the Lombards, for the queen, who was torn apart by pain she had fallen into depression with the intention of starving herself to death. Thanks to this special sauce with great properties and taste, the queen regains strength and vigor, and since then the dish has become iconic and traditional in Verona.

4 – Horse foot

According to ancient stories, the recipe for this famous typical Veronese dish has precise historical origins. At the end of the battle fought between the King of Italy Odoacer and the King of the Ostrogoths Theodoric, thousands of horses remained on the ground, which the people exhausted by hunger were authorized to recover to stock up. To have long-lasting use of the large quantity of meat, it was cut and left to macerate in red wine, with an abundance of spices and vegetables. The subsequent slow cooking led to the discovery of this exquisite dish, whose recipe passed down from generation to generation has survived to this day.

14,Extraordinary opening of the archaeological site under the Astra Cinema,"Extraordinary opening of the archaeological site under the Astra Cinema

This weekend, December 3rd, in the center of Verona there was the extraordinary opening of the archaeological site underneath the former Cinema Astra, in via Oberdan. The event immediately sold out. This is perhaps the most important Roman site in Verona, which for years was a few meters under the seats of the Veronese cinema and which was only found in 2004. The opening of the doors of the excavations will remain a unique event, in which we wanted to allow citizens, under the guidance of the archaeologist responsible for the construction site Mattia Berton, to view this magnificent discovery.
It is not yet certain what it was, what is clear is that it was a splendid house that lived through three phases from the Augustan and Flavian ages up to the 4th century AD, undergoing various renovations. Among the hypotheses of the superintendent Vincenzo Tinè, responsible and coordinator of the renovation works on the site, there is that of a luxury hotel. The site was ""sealed"" by the roof of the structure which had collapsed and burned down and it was perhaps thanks to these layers that covered the frescoes that the frescoes are still so well preserved today.
The future of the excavations is currently uncertain and is in private hands. The initial idea was to make the former Cinema Astra a multi-storey cinema, which is why the remains were found. To date, there are various hypotheses in this regard, including the construction of a three-level shopping center. There therefore remains the possibility of conceiving in the study of the new structure the possibility of a view of the excavations from above.

20,"THE TRADITIONAL ""BRUSA LA VECIA"" SKIPS IN VERONA","THE TRADITIONAL “BRUSA LA VECIA” SKIPS IN VERONA

For the third consecutive year the “Brusa la Vecia” in Piazza Bra is skipping.
In 2021 and 2022 the traditional Venetian event was canceled due to the Covid alert, this year it will be canceled due to the high concentration of PM10 in the air.
Due to air pollution, an orange alert has been triggered in the municipality of Verona since January 3rd, which entails various bans including the skipping of the Epiphany bonfire in the center of Verona. According to Palazzo Barbieri, the significant increase in PM10 in the air is due to the combined effect of the fireworks and the increase in atmospheric pressure.
The municipal administration has declared that it does not want to run the risk of a further increase in PM10 in the air, although it is difficult to quantify PM10 emissions from a bonfire.
However, the tradition of the Befana del Vigile remains active, an initiative traditionally organized by the local police. The meeting according to the program will be on January 6th from 9.30 am in Piazza San Zeno.

It wouldn't be carnival in Verona without the traditional figure of the DAD OF THE GNOCO, a chubby elderly man who with his red cheeks and a thick beard stands out from the crowd riding a mule through the streets of the city centre. Also this year, for the 493rd edition of the BACANAL DEL GNOCO or ""Festival of Abundance"", the Pope of Gnoco will be elected, the one who took away the Christmas spirit on January 6th.

On 10 January 2023 Ermes Marchiotto, known as “EL FUMO” and Fabio Prando, known as “EL BALOTA”, supported by the president of the senate of Papa' del Gnoco and the notary of the district, attempted the canonical dress test but only one of they will be able to hold the fork and wear the hat! We will have to wait for the voting on Sunday 15th, when the elections following the lawyers' debate held on 12th January will take place in Piazza San Zeno from 8am to 1pm, to find out who will have been elected.
WHO WILL DISTRIBUTE THE FAMOUS TOMATO GNOCCHI WITH STRACOTTO ON THE FAMOUS GNOCOLAR FRIDAY? Will it be EL FUMO delle Golosine again or his challenger in his first candidacy? WE WILL DISCOVER IT TOGETHER!

The PARPARO VECCHIO restaurant and kiosk in Roverè Veronese, located 40 km from Verona in the heart of Lessinia, at 1406 meters above sea level. Excellent for tasting mountain dishes such as GNOCCHI SBATUI WITH FIORETTA but also a starting point for an unforgettable experience among pastures and mountain huts, woods and pristine forests.

The monument closed all week.

The Arena is now under seizure by the Prosecutor's Office which has opened a case for negligent damage.

The fact:

During the dismantling of the well-known star in Piazza Bra, the internal base of the installation came loose, which would have damaged the steps of the Arena stalls.
The superintendent Vincenzo Tinè who intervened on site claims that there was a detachment of the base, caused by the rain. From an initial investigation it seems that this base, which rested on the amphitheatre, then rolled, damaging the steps before coming to a stop.

28,SNOWSHOEING IN THE SURROUNDINGS OF VERONA,"SNOWSHOEING IN THE SURROUNDINGS OF VERONA

Nature and sport in the soft snow of Lessinia

Imagine the weekend, a trip to Lessinia, a packed lunch, you and your friends or family wearing snowshoes on your feet... then think about finding yourself faced with a breathtaking view of the snow-capped mountains in front of you, it's not a dream?
We know that for nature and winter season lovers, spending the weekend in the snow is a recurring desire, so why not make it a reality?
Those of you who have never had the opportunity to experience snowshoeing will surely ask yourself: why snowshoes? Here are 5 good valid reasons:

It's a free experience, you can also rent them at some sports shops;
No particular skills are needed as there are different levels of difficulty to try, so it is an activity accessible to everyone;
You will be immersed in nature;
You will do sports and physical activity;
You will have fun in company.

Plus when you reach the finish line you will feel like you have completed your mission!
Always remember to dress like an onion with clothing suitable for winter temperatures that allow you to adapt to temperature variations and that accommodate the commitment necessary in tackling the walk. Furthermore, we recommend that you rely on local hiking guides who can guide you through the experience.
Here are some of the pleasant routes that we recommend in the surroundings of Verona:

When the snow cover is covered, a path is beaten that starts near the Malga San Giorgio near the parking lot along the provincial road where you can conveniently park your car. The latter connects the ski resort with Bosco Chiesanuova. A route with an easy and panoramic itinerary that connects San Giorgio, the Primaneve refuge of Monte Tomba and the Podestaria refuge. The travel time is about 3 hours.
Bocca di Selva is the ideal starting point for excursions during the winter season in the Lessinia Regional Natural Park. In addition to the already marked routes that connect the refuges of Alta Lessinia, you can also go snowshoeing over pristine hills and valleys.
Snowshoeing in western Lessinia to reach Corno d'Aquilio with breathtaking views of Monte Baldo, Carega, Brenta and Adamello. From Passo delle Fittanze you can climb towards Monte Cornetto and continue towards Passo Pealda, you will then reach Malga Casera Preta di Sopra and then you can continue to the small church near Spluga della Preta. Finally, the last stretch will take you to the cross of Corno d’Aquilio.

After a long walk you can't help but stop to drink a hot tea or a chocolate in the huts or refuges, we recommend some which, in our opinion, are unmissable.

35,VERONA: PET-FRIENDLY CITY,"VERONA: PET-FRIENDLY CITY

3 places in Verona where you can take your four-legged friend

Verona loves dogs at least as much as we do at Visitverona.net and in fact there are many activities in which furry friends can accompany us, such as walking along Corso Sant'Anastasia, exploring Piazza delle Erbe, admiring the Arena.
Often, even in cases where access to dogs is prohibited, it is possible to find a compromise: for example, they cannot enter Juliet's house, but they can access the courtyard where the famous Capulet balcony overlooks. Furthermore, in recent years, more and more bars and restaurants are welcoming animals. Especially for livelier dogs, however, being on a leash all day can be stressful.

What are the places where we can entertain our faithful companions?

Here are 3 suggestions!

DOG AREAS

Verona is a city full of green areas where our four-legged friends can play and socialize. Among the best we find:

The dog area of ​​Borgo Santa Croce (Via Rigoletto, 23) in the south-east of Verona. It is a fully fenced park, so owners can relax in the shade of beautiful trees knowing that their wagging friends are safe. The area is also equipped with benches, bins and a drinking water fountain.
Moving towards the city center, the Borgo Nuovo park (Via Pitagora) is certainly an excellent choice for letting our dogs run freely, it is in fact the largest fenced dog area in Verona. Unfortunately, benches are in short supply, but the Municipality is implementing a redevelopment plan to restore the area which will include, among other things, the inclusion of a kiosk-bar in the park.
Finally, a short distance away is the La Fratellanza dog area (Via La Fratellanza), adjacent to the Parco dell'Amicizia. The fenced area is surrounded by greenery and is full of trees. The only flaw is the proximity to the railway.

BRACCOBALDO BAU BEACH

The Braccobaldo Bau Beach, in Peschiera del Garda, is the perfect beach for those who don't want to give up a day at the lake in the company of their furry travel companion. Inaugurated in 2011, Bau Beach allows you to rent sunbeds, deckchairs and umbrellas, while dogs have access to a free sunbed, showers, and a welcome kit consisting of a bowl, blanket and bags. The area is entirely fenced and has 3 direct accesses to the lake.
The Braccobaldo Bau Beach during the summer season is open every day from 9.30 to 19.00. Reservation recommended.
Tel. +39 342 1254336
Address: Località Fornaci, 37019, Peschiera del Garda, VR
Website: https://www.pentagonorent.com/spiagge/
LIVE DOG BEACH

LiveDog Beach is a center dedicated to aquatic activities for our faithful companions. Both puppies and older dogs are welcome and, thanks to the various pools available, a gradual approach is possible: starting with pools of a few centimeters and then moving on to the deeper pool, based on the animal's predisposition. Not everyone is an expert swimmer, but at LiveDog Beach, dog and owner have the opportunity to play water games together accompanied by the dog trainer.

The proposals are well studied, made only with ingredients from small local producers: the cheeses are from Velo Veronese, the sopressa and speck from Bosco Chiesanuova, other culinary specialties and a selection of sausages from Sant'Anna d'Alfaedo. Depending on the time of year, the menu is enriched with seasonal proposals. The place itself has a mountain feel: the counter is built with wooden slats, the top is in red Verona marble and there is an ancient cart wheel and a ladder leaning against the wall as if to go up to the barn.

53,DISCOVER LESSINIA WITH 3 ROUTES?,"DISCOVER LESSINIA WITH 3 ROUTES?

TIPS FOR A DAY IN NATURE

If you are stressed due to the fast pace of city life but it's not yet time to go on holiday, don't worry! Lessinia will give you the energy you need.
The uncontaminated nature of this splendid plateau and the breathtaking views it offers are the perfect combination to fill up on energy on days when you can find some time to dedicate to your well-being.
We therefore recommend some excursions that you can do in company!
3 ROUTES TO EXPLORE LESSINIA

1| EXCURSION ON THE EAGLE'S HORN

If you are a trekking enthusiast, this route is for you. The excursion to Corno d’Aquilio starts from Tommasi, where you can leave your car. The route begins a little further on, you will need to follow the signs and cross the woods until you reach Passo di Rocca Pia. Afterwards, after passing some hairpin bends, you will reach the pastures of Malga Fanta from which you can admire the Corno d’Aquilio and, a few hundred meters away, also the Spluga della Preta, an abyss more than 800 meters deep.
The truly daredevils who decide to continue to the top of the Horn will be greeted by an iron cross and a breathtaking view. The return involves passing through the Grotta del Ciabattino and continuing until reaching the Liana road and the Tommasi district, the starting point of the excursion.
The trail takes about 3 and a half hours and is of medium difficulty with a difference in altitude of 550 metres.
Aquilian Horn
2| THE MAGIC OF THE FOLIGNANI FOREST

The itinerary for the Folignani Forest starts from the Bocca di Selva Refuge and continues towards the valley for a few hundred metres. Subsequently you will have to turn right and you will find yourself crossing pastures and woods until you reach the long-awaited Foresta dei Folignani, the wildest area of ​​Lessinia which will give you a priceless panorama. This area is also a Site of Community Interest and thanks to the important presence of beeches, silver firs and black hornbeams it becomes an ideal place for birdwatching! After passing the forest you descend towards Vajo dell'Anguilla, passing through Masse, Maselli and Scandole, from which begins the ascent to return to the starting point.
The duration of this route (which can be done on foot, by mountain bike and even on horseback!) is 5 hours, but it is still recommended even for the less experienced given that the difference in altitude is medium.
Folignani Forest

3| VALLEY OF THE SPHINXES

With the arrival of the warm season, the desire to walk increases and surely the route in the Valley of the Sphinxes will give you unforgettable moments discovering rock formations similar to real… sphinxes.
We advise you to park in Camposilvano and, following the signs, in a few minutes you will find yourself in the wonderful valley thanks to a dirt path with a particular mushroom shape. The path continues through a meadow that will take you to the Bivio delle Gosse (highest point of the path!) from which you can enjoy a breathtaking view. From here the descent will begin which, following the signs, will take you to the Lausen refuge where you can stop for a nice break. The itinerary ends here and you can then set off towards the starting point.
The route (can be done on foot or by mountain bike) lasts approximately 3 hours and has a difference in altitude of 300 metres, ideal for a beautiful excursion in nature.

57,WHERE TO ADMIRE THE PANORAMA IN VERONA?,"WHERE TO ADMIRE THE PANORAMA IN VERONA?

Journey to discover the panoramic points of the city

Verona, a city of art and history but also an enchanting setting during the most beautiful hour of the day, the sunset. The city enjoys several panoramic points that offer a breathtaking view of its extraordinary beauties. Here is a list of the most beautiful spots to admire Verona and take fantastic souvenir photos.
5 UNMISSABLE PANORAMIC POINTS OF VERONA

1| SAN PIETRO CASTLE

One of the most well-known and wonderful panoramic points of the city. From Castel San Pietro it is worth waiting for sunset to enjoy a golden hour that is the envy of the whole world. The sun's rays reflecting on the body of water of the Adige, the wind moving the leaves of the cypress trees and the city
To reach this panoramic terrace it is necessary to climb about 200 steps, but the road is worth every effort. Alternatively, you can reach the panoramic point by car or by funicular.
Castel San Pietro

2| VIEWPOINT OF THE SANCTUARY OF OUR LADY OF LOURDES

Positioned on the hill of San Leonardo di Belvedere, the “Nostra Signora di Lourdes” sanctuary offers a phenomenal view of the city of Verona. Precisely because of its elevated position it is particularly recognizable from afar, especially from Ponte Pietra.
From the latter we suggest you reach the panoramic point with a quiet 20-minute walk. Alternatively, the sanctuary can also be reached by car. In fact, it is located just 4 kilometers from the historic centre.
Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes

3| LAMBERTI TOWER

In the city center lies the Torre dei Lamberti which, with its notable 84 meters in height, holds the record as the tallest building in Verona. It is possible to go up and enjoy a 360° panorama of the city through the stairs, which have 368 steps, or by means of a glass elevator.
For prices and opening hours, please visit the official website of the Torre dei Lamberti.
Lamberti Tower

4| RIGHT GARDEN

Another splendid panoramic point can be found by visiting Giardino Giusti, one of the most luxuriant gardens of the Italian Renaissance.
In addition to the wonderful walk among flowerbeds, statues, fountains, stairways and artificial caves, the view of the city from this point elevated above the historic center is also radiant.
Also in this case it is necessary to consult the official website of the Giusti Garden for more information regarding access times and the cost of the entry ticket.

5| CIVIC MUSEUM OF CASTELVECCHIO

The Castelvecchio Civic Museum in Verona is a particular panoramic point, as it offers a suggestive view of the Adige river and its surroundings thanks to its strategic position. The medieval fortress that houses the museum is in fact located directly on the banks of the river, and from its windows and terraces it is possible to admire the surrounding landscape. In particular, we recommend the Mastio terrace to enjoy the view of the city.

58,5 OUT-OF-TOWN TRIPS IN THE PROVINCE OF VERONA,"5 OUT-OF-TOWN TRIPS IN THE PROVINCE OF VERONA

5 unmissable destinations to immerse yourself in history and nature near Verona

Verona is a city full of attractions, a true open-air museum. However, its surroundings also offer enchanting places for those who want to spend a day in the open air.

5 IDEAS FOR A TRIP TO THE PROVINCE OF VERONA!

Here are 5 proposals that you should absolutely consider.
MOLINA WATERFALLS

MOLINA WATERFALLS

The Molina Waterfalls park is the perfect place to spend a day outdoors away from the city. Immersed in the heart of the Lessinia Regional Park, the waterfalls create fairy-tale landscapes, where the sound of the water accompanies hikers who, from time to time, will also be able to see prehistoric caves and some rock engravings.
Each of the 3 routes you choose to take ends with the most famous attraction of the park, the giant swing where you swing until you touch the water of the waterfall. Trekking boots are recommended, avoid flip-flops and uncomfortable shoes, as in some places the paths can be rough or slippery.
In the park there is a bar and toilets and tables and benches are available for picnics. During the winter the park is closed, while for the spring and autumn periods the openings and entrances vary, we therefore recommend consulting the website by clicking here.
The full ticket costs €7, the reduced ticket for children between 6 and 12 years old is €4.50, while under 6 years old entry is free.
BORGHETTO SUL MINCIO

BORGHETTO SUL MINCIO

Borghetto sul Mincio is one of the hidden jewels of Verona and one of the most beautiful villages in Italy. It is a very small village, a fraction of the municipality of Valeggio sul Mincio, but it is worth visiting for the evocative atmosphere and the wonderful views it offers.
Among the most scenic places there is certainly the imposing Scaligero castle. The building was almost completely razed to the ground by an earthquake in 1117, which however spared the Round Tower, about fifteen meters high, which can now be accessed to see the splendid panorama. The ticket to access the tower costs €2.
Typical dish of the village absolutely worth trying are tortellini, also called ""love knots"", filled with beef, pork, chicken, natural flavourings, Bardolino wine and a little grated bread (depending on the recipes) cooked together , to be eaten in broth or with butter.
VAL BORAGO

VAL BORAGO

About ten minutes from the center of Verona, there is the magical Val Borago path. It is a route immersed in nature, between canyons carved by water and rich vegetation that will make you forget that you are a stone's throw from the city center. The Vajo undergrowth has a large variety of plants such as ivy, fern, moss and algae.
The route consists of a ring of approximately 12km and is also suitable for those who are not particularly fit. It is advisable to wear trekking shoes, as the terrain is subject to changes according to the season due to the streams appearing and disappearing in the vegetation
SANCTUARY OF THE MADONNA DELLA CORONA

SANCTUARY OF THE MADONNA DELLA CORONA

The sanctuary of the Madonna della Corona is a splendid sanctuary set in the mountain, overlooking the Adige Valley.
Medieval documents attest that a monastery and a chapel already existed in 1200. The original chapel of the sanctuary was inaugurated in 1530 and was located a few meters below the current level of the church. The current church dates back to the 17th century, although it has undergone many renovations and expansions over time, the last of which in 1975.
The route to reach it begins in Spiazzi (a hamlet of Caprino Veronese), where you can leave the car and take a short downhill walk (15 minutes) to reach the sanctuary. Mountain clothing and trekking shoes are recommended.
For disabled people, children or simply for those who do not want to walk, there is a shuttle bus service leaving every 30 minutes from the squares. The cost of the bus ticket is €1.80 (€3.00 return).
SAN GIORGIO DI VALPOLICELLA

SAN GIORGIO DI VALPOLICELLA

San Giorgio di Valpolicella is a wonderful village that dominates the landscape of Valpolicella. In fact, from the hill you can admire a panorama that reaches, on the clearest days, as far as the Brescia shore of Lake Garda. The position is very particular and in fact the village is also called Ingannapoltron, that is, 'deceive the lazy'. This is linked to the fact that the village appears very close to the towns on the plain, but the climb to reach it is much more tiring than it appears.
In the center of San Giorgio is the Romanesque parish church, dating back to the 7th-8th century. Next to it there is an evocative 12th century cloister and a small museum which preserves prehistoric finds found in the area. Also highly recommended is an aperitif at sunset at the Red Zone Art Bar, a small place that offers an extraordinary view.

Flavors of the Veronese carnival tradition

The oldest and best known mask of Papa Del Gnoco, as many of you know, dates back to the 16th century when the city had to face a terrible famine due to the flooding of the Adige river. It is said that Tommaso Da Vico, a well-known doctor from Verona, distributed portions of gnocchi made with flour and water to the entire population at his expense. Precisely in honor of him, a day was established which is repeated every year in which plates of steaming gnocchi and wine are distributed free of charge. The original gnoco stone on which the food was divided is still present today inside the basilica of San Zeno.
There are those who will have the pleasure of seeing him during the Carnival float parade on the back of his mule with the large fork (the ""Piron"") while he skewers an enormous dumpling.
However, we have also thought about those who will not be able to be present at this event and will want to taste the gnocchi on another occasion.

63,WHERE TO GO TO THE SEA NOT FAR FROM VERONA?,"WHERE TO GO TO THE SEA NOT FAR FROM VERONA?

COASTS NOT FAR FROM THE CITY OF ROMEO AND JULIET

Summer is upon us and with it also the desire to take a nice refreshing dip! In Verona the heat is increasing and long and difficult days await sea lovers.
This is why we at Visitverona.net recommend some beaches not far from the city, excellent for those looking for a quiet sunny day but also for those who love nightlife.
Below you will find some seaside destinations that have also obtained the ""Blue Flag"" recognition during 2023.

5 BEACHES IN VENETO NOT TO BE MISSED
1| JESOLO

If what you are looking for are these three words: sun, sea and party, Jesolo is undoubtedly the destination for you!
The famous and very popular coastline is 15 kilometers long and is made up of very fine sand.
The beach is well equipped, sunbeds and umbrellas can be booked. At almost every access to the sea there are cold showers and kiosks where you can have breakfast or lunch directly with your feet on the sand.
In some areas it is also possible to find paid showers, for a nice refreshment before a dinner in the central Via Bafile or before an evening in one of the numerous clubs in the seaside city.
Four-legged friends are allowed on Bau Bau Beach.
Jesolo

2| CAORLE

Perfect mix between history, culture and metatourism and seaside. Caorle is spread between Trieste and Venice and is easily reachable from Verona by train (as well as by car). This city offers tourists and locals the opportunity both to spend a nice day at the seaside and to spend a few hours among the numerous streets in the historic center, characterized by restaurants, hotels and shops.
Once you arrive at your destination you will find yourself faced with a choice: the Ponente beach or the Levante beach? The first is characterized by a greater depth of water, while the second has a wider beach; the difficult decision therefore depends on what you prefer for your vitamin D day.
Curiosity: the name ""Caorle"" seems to derive from an ancient forest in the area where many wild goats grazed!
Caorle

3| BIBIONE

Whether you want sun, sea or nature, Bibione is a combination of all this, the city was born from a set of artificial canals which, using the waterways, connect the Venice Lagoon with the mouth of the Isonzo river! Further well-equipped coastline with sunbeds and umbrellas and a ""smoke-free"" beach area.
A further service offered is entertainment for children which consists of creativity and training workshops, but also activities such as beach volleyball and sailing with certified teachers. Furthermore, if crowded beaches make you feel stressed, we have the solution for you : the spa of Bibione!
Bibione

4| ERACLEA

An oasis of sea and nature, Eraclea is the perfect destination for those who want to enjoy their summer holiday in an area complete with all services but not too chaotic. Here free beaches and equipped beaches balance each other perfectly! They are made up of fine sand and the depth of the sea increases gradually, allowing even the less experienced to swim with peace of mind.
The area is also easily reachable by public transport starting from Mestre or Venice, therefore also perfect for Veronese people who want to leave without a car! This location is also defined as the Green Pearl of the Adriatic thanks to its naturalistic beauties such as the Lagoon of Mort!
Eraclea

5| SUBMARINE

A very popular seaside resort for those who want to enjoy the sun and the sea without giving up a bit of history and culture.
Here the beach is about ten kilometers long, the sea has a dark and sandy seabed, you can find numerous seafront hotels and the city center is perfect for an evening walk. On the seafront it is also possible to find a small amusement park that will entertain the little ones.
If you love quiet areas, we recommend the Dam area, where you can walk on the rocks listening to the sound of the sea, not far from the busiest centre. Also not to be missed is the nearby city of Chioggia, known as ""Little Venice"" for its its characteristic conformation, with small streets and waterways that cross it, making it very similar to the Venetian capital.

PRACTICAL TIPS FOR COMBAT HIGH TEMPERATURES

Summer is not always synonymous with holiday! In many cases it means scorching heat and for those who do not live in cool areas or near the sea it is not easy to find a solution other than taking refuge in the house with the air conditioner.
For this reason, we at Visitverona.net have decided to share with you some of the places in and around the city that will allow you to breathe some fresh air or relieve the heat!

3+1 IDEAS TO SAVE FOR THE SUMMER IN VERONA
1| TORRICELLE, THE HILLS OF VERONESE

To the north of the city are the ""Toresele"" which in Veronese dialect means the Torricelle, the hills that close the landscape of the beautiful city. An evocative place for both tourists and locals, they are ideal for a walk in nature and to admire the city from above while enjoying a cooler temperature.
Here, in addition to restaurants with amazing views and places where you can drink a refreshing cocktail, it is possible to spend a few hours in the shadow of the ancient city walls built in the Scaliger era. Curiosity: the name “Torricelle” derives from the 4 Austrian cylindrical towers that were built in the 19th century to defend Verona.

2| MONTE BIANCO SWIMMING POOLS

For a swim or a relaxing day by the pool, we recommend the Monte Bianco swimming pools located in the eastern area of ​​Verona. Usable both in winter and summer thanks to its outdoor swimming pools, it is ideal for a day with friends outdoors and for a swim in the fresh pool water.
There is also a green outdoor garden and a beach bar and in the changing rooms you will find paid showers and hairdryers.

3| WATERMELON KIOSKS

We know that with the arrival of the heat, eating fruit and vegetables and drinking often is beneficial (more than during the rest of the year)! Precisely for this reason, watermelon kiosks are a real salvation for summer evenings when the heat seems to have the upper hand.
In many neighborhoods of the city it is possible to find one where you can go to enjoy a nice slice of fresh watermelon. Among the most popular is the historic Kiosk of San Zeno, now a meeting point for the inhabitants of the area. If you are not a watermelon lover, don't worry, you will also find granitas and savory dishes, suitable for all tastes.

70,AFTER 30 YEARS THE ISTHmus OF RABBIT ISLAND RE-emerges,"AFTER 30 YEARS THE ISTHmus OF RABBIT ISLAND RE-emerges

As many of you will have heard, in Manerba sul Garda (BS) the isthmus that connects the small ISLAND OF RABBITS, also called ""ISLAND OF SAN BIAGIO"" with the mainland has resurfaced, the water level of Lake Garda is not never been so low.
Although it is necessary to remember and be aware of the problems that afflict our beloved Lake, the lunar landscape that can be admired these days is something that has not been seen for a long time.
A walk on the walkway formed by the strip of land in the middle of the lake is the attraction that all tourists want to see. By bike or on foot, alone or in the company of your four-legged friends, the path is easily accessible.
HOW TO GET TO RABBIT ISLAND?

We at Visitverona.net give you simple directions to get to this enchanted place with a magnificent panorama.
Less than 1 hour from Verona, Manerba sul Garda can be easily reached by car. First of all, we would like to point out the paid parking at 1 euro per hour on the Lido di Manerba sul Garda, near Porto Torchio. From here a simple 1.5/2 km walk along the coast. We advise you to avoid driving up to the entrance to the San Biagio campsite which, during the low season, is closed and you will not be able to continue.
However, when the water is high, there is a taxi boat service that takes you to your destination from Porto Torchio for €2.50 each way.
WHAT WILL YOU FIND ON YOUR ARRIVAL AT RABBIT ISLAND?

Once along the corridor, you will be able to admire the green of the cypress trees and bushes and the turquoise water points during the summer, as well as the view of Rocca di Manerba and the coves of the coast. In the summer you can still meet bunnies who are now accustomed to human presence and a kiosk with tables, now closed, where you can order a fresh ice cream or a coffee.
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO ENTER RABBIT ISLAND?

Since 2007 the island has been the property of the campsite, which is why in summer you have to pay entry, €5 for the whole day. Deckchairs and umbrellas are also available for rental.
Will you visit this amazing place? If so, tag us in your stories or posts using @veronasocialofficial, @visitveronaofficial and @lagodigardasocial.

Below we at VisitVerona.net recommend some unusual places that will allow you to visit the city of Verona and learn about its history in a different way, more peaceful and away from the crowds of tourists.

3+1 LESS KNOWN PLACES IN VERONA
1| WELL OF LOVE

Verona, renowned city of love famous for the tragic story of Romeo and Juliet, holds another fascinating love story: that of Corrado and Isabella and their ""Well of Love"". According to legend, Corrado di San Bonifazio, a young soldier of the Holy Roman Empire, fell in love with Isabella Donati, who however did not reciprocate her feelings.
One day, Corrado met Isabella in the courtyard of the church of San Marco and accused her of being as cold as the water in the well there. In response, Isabella provoked him by inviting him to throw himself into the well. Without hesitation, the young man threw himself in. To his surprise, Isabella, who actually had a secret love for him, was struck by the gesture and also dived into the icy waters of the well.
Well of love

2| UNDERGROUND VERONA

Going down the stairs in the Benetton store, in via Mazzini, you can find the remains of ancient Verona. During the renovation of the shop, an extraordinary underground Verona was discovered. Here it is possible to admire a section of a Roman domus, some architectural structures and a refined geometric mosaic for free.

3| MOUTHS OF SECRET COMPLAINTS

Walking through the center of Verona, you may notice some strange faces with their mouths wide open hanging on the wall of the Palazzo della Ragione. These particular works are the so-called ""letterboxes"", of medieval origin, used for citizen complaints addressed to the local judiciary known as ""Boche per le Denunzie Segrete"" or in Venetian dialect ""Boche de leòn"".
For a complaint to be considered valid, it needed to be supported by substantial evidence and confirmed by at least three witnesses. In the absence of these requirements, the complaint was burned!
Mouths of secret denunciations

4| THE PALACES THAT MAKE THEIR MOUTHS

Pranks and jokes carved in stone in Verona. Along via San Cosimo there is one of the most curious buildings of Veronese architecture: the Turco-Sagramoso-Scandola palace, known as ""the house of puoti"", which in local dialect means ""puppets"". The facade of this palace features caryatids and Telamons, that is, male and female figures used as support elements.
Opposite is the Vimercati Malaspina house, which has a nice ""door head"": a large mask with an enormous tongue protruding. It would seem that he is making faces at the caryatids in the building opposite, scaring them!

3| BORGHETTO SUL MINCIO

If you want to dive into the past, but at the same time stay close to Lake Garda, the village of Borghetto is the perfect destination. Located on the Mincio river, it enchants with its ancient fortifications dating back to the medieval period.
Along the streets of the village you can let yourself be carried away by the relaxing sound of the water flowing between the mills, and admire the imposing fortresses of the Visconti Bridge, the extraordinary fortified dam built in 1393 and the evocative Scaligero Castle.
The charm of this village has not gone unnoticed, in fact it was recently included in the Club of the most beautiful villages in Italy.

4| THE FORTIFIED CITY – PESCHIERA SUL GARDA

Built by the Scaligeri, this picturesque town offers much more than enchanting views and pleasant walks along the shore.
An example is the Fortress of Peschiera, with a pentagonal shape which has embraced the city since the sixteenth century with its mighty walls, bastions, bridges and access gates, defending it from the enemies of the past. It is here that the Mincio river, an emissary of Lake Garda, immerses itself, whose natural course was modified specifically to allow the construction of this fortress.
Its particular conformation therefore makes it different from all the other towns on Lake Garda.

Every year it falls on August 10th and represents a fascinating moment to share that creates a romantic atmosphere. If you too have wondered where you can go to honor this custom, below we give you some gems to save.

VISIT EUROPEAN CITIES WITH ZERO WORRIES

Beautiful Italy, as we know, is unsurpassable. Fascinating villages, cities of art rich in history and culture, natural oases in which to immerse yourself. Yet even beyond national borders there are many treasures to discover, new cultures to learn about, and landscapes to admire. September is one of the most suitable months for travel, because the temperatures become milder and the days are still quite long.
The plane and the car are not the only alternative: for a trip by land, in fact, the train is often an optimal solution, because it allows you to easily reach the big cities and at the same time enjoy the view. This is why we at VisitVerona.net have selected 3 itineraries to reach some of the most beautiful European cities by train.

3 TIPS FOR TRAIN TRIPS TO EUROPE FROM VERONA

Vienna is a city that cannot be missed on a trip to Europe: in the historic centre, which we recommend visiting on foot so as not to miss even a detail of the beauty that surrounds the streets, there is no shortage of artistic and historical attractions such as noble palaces and the masterpieces of Gothic style architecture.

92,55th ISOLA DELLA SCALA RICE FAIR,"55th ISOLA DELLA SCALA RICE FAIR

THE LARGEST EVENT DEDICATED TO ITALIAN RISOTTO

From 13 September to 8 October one of the most important fairs in Verona returns, a great food and wine festival where tradition, history and culture come together in one great specialty of the Verona area: risotto.

THE MOST ANTICIPATED CULINARY EVENT IN VERONA

Born over half a century ago, the Isola della Scala Rice Fair continues an ancient peasant tradition: that of the festivals held at the end of the harvest period in the agricultural areas of the Po Valley. At the time it was very different from how we know it today: it was in fact a small stand in the center of the town that served risotto and wine for a few days.
Today, however, it has grown in size, but has not forgotten its decades of history: what makes risotto so special, in fact, is the respect for ancient traditional recipes, which have made it one of the most loved dishes of Italian cuisine.
Like every year, it will be held in Isola della Scala, the territory of the resurgences, where streams of clear and pure water feed the rice fields, giving life to an excellent product of the Veronese plain: Nano Vialone Veronese PGI rice, the king of rice risotto as it is able to fully absorb the flavors of the seasonings that accompany it and maintain cooking.
The undisputed protagonist of the fair is risotto all'isolana, a recipe of inestimable value, so much so that in 1985 the then mayor of the municipality of Isola della Scala made it official with a resolution. In addition to this specialty, in Palariso the countless food stands will serve alternative risottos that enhance local products, prepared by expert chefs.
Every day to accompany the culinary experience there will be countless exhibition stands of objects, shows, competitions, conferences and events of various types: the calendar is full of events not to be missed! You can consult it HERE or by downloading the “Fiera di Isola” App, to always be updated.
For reservations and to discover other curiosities about the fair, we recommend that you consult the official SITE. Palariso is open from Monday to Friday from 12:00.

THE STORIES THAT FEW KNOW ABOUT THE CITY

Verona, a city rich in history and charm, hides within its ancient walls a series of legends and popular tales that have always fascinated generations of Veronese and the most curious visitors.
VisitVerona takes you to discover the other side of the coin of the city of Romeo and Juliet, that of the enigmatic prophecies that still hover in the air. We are sure that, after reading this article, when you walk through the city streets, you will look around with dreamy eyes full of mysticism.

3+1 MYTHS ABOUT VERONA TO KNOW
1| THE GHOST OF CANGRANDE DELLA SCALA

The legend of the ghost of Castelvecchio in Verona tells of a mysterious spirit who is said to still live inside the imposing medieval castle. It is thought to be the ghost of Cangrande della Scala, one of the most famous lords of the city in the 13th century belonging to the Scaligera family. He governed Verona during an era of great splendor and his sudden and enigmatic death gave rise to numerous folklore tales.
According to legend, Cangrande della Scala died in 1329, probably poisoned, but there is no certainty. It is said that his spirit manifests itself in particular ways, such as unusual noises, including footsteps or voices coming from the empty halls of the castle. Some have reported feeling a sensation of an invisible presence or having glimpsed an elusive shadow between the ancient walls.
The legend of the ghost of Castelvecchio has become an integral part of the history and charm of the castle which evokes a sense of mystery. Many visitors are fascinated by the possibility of encountering the energy of Cangrande della Scala and, regardless of the veracity of the legend, the ghost of Castelvecchio continues to intrigue people.
CASTELVECCHIO

2| VERONA: CURSED ROME

According to legend, during the 4th century BC, the Gallic leader Brennus led an army of Celts to conquer northern Italy. Rome was one of the cities that firmly opposed their advance. Brennus and his warriors clashed with the Roman army and suffered a heavy defeat in the famous battle of the Allia river, in 390 BC.
After the victory, the Roman army invaded the territory of the Celts and headed towards the village of Brenno, located in the area that would become Verona. Brennus, desperate for the defeat and full of anger towards the Romans, decided to found a new city to challenge the power of Rome.
The myth tells that Brennus decided to give his city a name that expressed his curse towards Rome. So, he called the city “Vae Roma“, which in Latin means “Cursed Rome“. Over time, the name transformed into Verona, maintaining its original meaning.
BRENNO

3| THE LEGEND OF THE BALA DI FRACASTORO

The third legend we will tell you concerns the statue of Girolamo Fracastoro still visible above the arch in via Fogge which leads to Piazza dei Signori. According to tradition, the statue holds a globe in its hand, affectionately called by the Veronese ""la bala de Fracastoro"" or ""the ball of Fracastoro"".
The arch is located near the ancient courthouse of Verona, and it is said that many judges and lawyers passed under it during their daily commute. According to legend, the people, who looked askance at the legal authorities, invented an ironic prophecy stating that the sphere (the “bala”) would fall on the head of the first honest man who passed under the arch.
The prophecy was likely a veiled form of ridicule toward judges and lawyers, giving the impression that honesty was a rare trait among those in the justice system. However, the prophecy never came true and remained, in fact, only a legend.
FRACASTORO

4| STONE BRIDGE, BUT NOT AT SUNSET!

According to a Veronese legend handed down from generation to generation, Ponte Pietra, one of the oldest and most iconic bridges in the city, is linked to a curse that manifests itself at sunset.
The myth tells of a forbidden love between a young Veronese woman and a nobleman from an opposing family. The two lovers met secretly at night on the Ponte Pietra to live their furtive love. However, when their families discovered their relationship, it sparked a fierce conflict between the two houses, leading to the deaths of the two lovers.
From that moment it is thought that every evening, as the sun goes down, cracks and fissures appear on the stones of the bridge, as a palpable manifestation of the pain and loss caused by love that ended in tragedy.
Furthermore, it is said that if a person dares to cross Ponte Pietra after dark, while the curse is in progress, he or she may suffer a series of unfortunate events, such as accidents, illnesses or misfortunes.

THE PROGRAM AND EVENTS NOT TO BE MISSED

This year too, the most fun and colorful party, loved by adults and children, includes a program full of events. The latter, colorful and fun, will make the 2024 Carnival in Verona a memory of unforgettable days. Do you know the origins of the Veronese carnival?

This is the third historic carnival in Italy, now in its 494th edition. According to tradition, the Papa del Gnoco is the oldest and best-known mask of the Carnival in Verona, whose original name is ""Bacanàl del Gnoco"" and whose origins date back to the 16th century. In that period the city had to face a terrible famine due to the flooding of the Adige river. It is said that, for this reason, Tommaso Da Vico, a well-known doctor from Verona, offered portions of gnocchi to the entire population at his own expense.

The latter, made with flour and water, meant that, in his honour, a day was established which is repeated every year: the ""GNOCOLAR FRIDAY""! During the latter, free food and wine are distributed. Did you know that the original gnoco stone (on which the food was distributed) is still present today inside the basilica of San Zeno?

CARNIVAL 2024 IN VERONA

Below we list the list of events for the 2024 Carnival in Verona. The Carnival in the city began on January 6 with the official inauguration in Piazza Bra and the installation of the statue of Papà del Gnoco in Piazza San Zeno.

TYPICAL DISHES OF THE VERONA CARNIVAL

It is known that Carnival in Verona is a deeply felt festivity. It is celebrated in a big way with the traditional parade of allegorical floats and with the election of the Father of the Gnoco: the ""Sire of Verona"". We have already advised you which Carnival events not to miss in a previous article. Today we will talk to you about the traditional dishes which, during the carnival period, cannot be missing from the tables of the Veronese. So let's see the Carnival in Verona: traditional sweets and dishes.

TYPICAL CARNIVAL DISHES IN VERONA
1 | THE GNOCCHI

Gnocchi are certainly the best-known dish of the Verona Carnival and are enjoyed above all during the so-called ""Venerdì Gnocolar"", that is, the last Friday before Lent. During this day, in fact, tradition dictates that a plate of gnocchi is eaten for lunch. The seasoning varies from tomato sauce to butter and sage, but there are also those who season them with 'pastissada de caval', horse stew, a sauce that the Veronese are fond of.
GNOCCHI

2 | THE FRIES

After a nice and substantial first course we certainly can't sin on dessert. Fritters, ""fritole"" in Verona, are the favorite end of the meal for the Veronese at Carnival. The union of flour, sugar, eggs, apples, sultanas and, obviously, a little grappa, creates magnificent irregular spheres. These are fried and sprinkled with icing sugar. What you get are sweets that are crunchy on the outside but soft and meltable on the inside: a real delight for the palate. Veronese pancakes are an unmissable treat in the pastry shops and in the homes of the inhabitants of Verona during the Carnival period.
FRITTLES

3| IN GALLONS

Last, but not least: the chiacchiere, in Verona called ""galani"": thin sheets of dough fried and sprinkled with icing sugar. A crunchy and crumbly dessert perfect for finishing meals or as a snack. We assure you... after the first bite it will be difficult to stop. This dish is always present during the Carnival period and many are produced and sold throughout the city.

145,THE 5 BEST HOT CHOCOLATE IN VERONA AND WHERE TO FIND THEM,"THE 5 BEST HOT CHOCOLATE IN VERONA AND WHERE TO FIND THEM

Warm your heart in the Scaligera city with our tips

Hot chocolate, for many of us, is a valid ally and a pleasant companion on cold winter days. We know different varieties of this sweet treat which, especially if accompanied with a dollop of cream, is and has always been an irresistible temptation since ancient times.
The first version of hot chocolate, in fact, dates back to Mayan times, but it included a totally different recipe from the drink we know today: it had a bitter and spicy taste, as it consisted of a mixture of cocoa and water seasoned with spices.

From the Maya we return to the cold winter of beautiful Verona to discover five places that offer a moment of pleasure for both body and soul:

5 RECOMMENDED ACTIVITIES TO DO IN VERONA

Verona always fascinates. Its history, its monuments, the places of Romeo and Juliet are what makes thousands of people fall in love with it every year. The Arena, Piazza Erbe, Castel San Pietro are always magical, but there are some little-known experiences that allow you to experience the city in absolutely unconventional and new ways!
SO HERE ARE 5 UNUSUAL EXPERIENCES TO DO IN VERONA!

1 | Write a letter to Juliet

Verona receives thousands of letters every year from lovers from all over the world who tell of their love adventures. This tradition originated in 1930, when the keeper of Juliet's Tomb began to collect the first love messages left by tourists and respond, thus becoming the first 'Juliet's Secretary'. Today Juliet's Post Office is managed by a team appointed by the Municipality of Verona, the Juliet Club, a non-profit cultural association which carefully responds to every letter in Juliet's name. The association also makes its staff available archives with thousands of letters from all over the world and every year awards the Dear Juliet Award, dedicated to the most beautiful letters received by the Club.
All you have to do is tell your story: it is possible to send a simple email, although it is recommended to write to Juliet in the more traditional way, using pen and paper and sending the letter or posting it directly in the appropriate red boxes (at Juliet's House or at the Juliet Club headquarters).

4THE RIGHTEOUS GARDENS

This green oasis is located 10 minutes from the Arena. Here you can find collections of flowers and important Roman finds.

A square of fundamental importance for Verona, in Roman times it housed the Forum. Today you can admire palaces, towers, statues and architectural elements from various eras that come together to form a unique and unrepeatable mosaic.

Our advice is to take the steps you find in front of the bridge to get to the square of Castel San Pietro and admire the breathtaking view of Verona.

9I PORTA BORSARI

This majestic gate of Roman origin was originally called Porta Iovia because of its proximity to a temple dedicated to Jupiter Iustrale.

Bonus: stop by the smallest jewelry store in the world (only 3.78 square meters) in Corso Porta Borsari, you won't regret it!

FALL IN LOVE IN VERONA
1| GIULIETTA'S HOME

A fixed stop for lovers who visit Verona is Juliet's house whose balcony is by far the most remembered symbol of the love story. The latter narrates that the two lovers met right here, in the moonlight. Inside Juliet's house there are architectural and decorative elements from the medieval era, originals and replicas. The house includes, in addition to the famous balcony, also the statue of Juliet, an original work by Nereo Costantini. And have you ever tried your luck by touching the right breast of the representation of the young woman?

2| JULIET'S TOMB

Located in the G.B. Fresco Museum. Cavalcaselle, Juliet's tomb is an attraction much appreciated by tourists and beyond. Here you can admire the red marble sarcophagus in which the young woman must have been buried after taking her own life. The tomb, located in what is believed to be the convent of San Francesco al Corso dei Frati Cappuccini, is a symbol of troubled and unhappy but eternal love. Have you ever been there?

3| ROMEO'S HOUSE

Perhaps one of the most underrated symbols of Shakespearean tragedy, this place is actually rich in history. Located in via Arche Scaligere, 5, it is believed that this palace was the home of the Montecchi family until the beginning of the 14th century. According to historians, however, this house belonged only to Cagnolo Nogarola, the descendant of a powerful family of French origin. Looking carefully at the high crenellated walls, you can see a plaque engraved with a fragment of the play in which Romeo and Juliet are the protagonists. Did you already know about this residence?

A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

Verona is a city that preserves numerous signs of history. In fact, this city hides ""layers"" that conceal the passage of past civilizations. In Verona these finds are unique in their kind: not only because they are very numerous, but also because they are very easily accessible. It will be enough to go down a few meters below the street level to descend into the streets, temples and houses that stood in the city two thousand years ago.
Which are the most suggestive? We at VisitVerona.net have created a perfect program to see the best of the underground part of this city full of history.

3+1 REMAINS OF ROMAN VERONA
1| THE CAPITOLIUM

Right under the Palazzo Maffei in Piazza delle Erbe are the remains of the Capitolium, the most important temple of any Roman city. Its presence is a real proof of the importance of Verona in Roman times. Inside, the Capitoline triad was venerated: Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. The remains of this temple are located 9 meters underground, more precisely under the cellars of the Maffei Restaurant.
MAFFEI PALACE

2| SCALIGERI EXCAVATIONS

In the Courtyard of the International Center of Photography of the Scavi Scaligeri you can admire the remains of buildings from the 1st century BC to the 15th century AD. The domus decorated with elegant mosaics and a Roman pavement with sidewalks and sewerage are not to be missed. Temporary exhibitions are regularly set up inside this space.
SCALIGERI EXCAVATIONS

3| LION DOOR

Porta Leoni gave access to the cardo maximus, one of the two main road axes of Roman Verona. The name of this famous door derives from the fact that a sarcophagus with two lions carved into it was found nearby. With the same structure as Portoni Borsari, in the Republican age they were both made of bricks and tuff, but later they were embellished with a covering of white limestone. While only the external part of Porta Borsari has remained visible today, the brick structure of Porta Leoni can also be seen.
LION GATE

+1| SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS

Verona also stands out because in numerous shops, restaurants, churches, bars and hotels you can observe finds from the Roman era. One of the most famous examples is that of the Benetton store: located in via Mazzini, the shopping street par excellence in Verona. Here, among the clothes you can see the remains of the Roman period of Verona. Another hidden pearl of the city of Verona is the Dodici Apostoli restaurant, where following renovation works on the restaurant some remains of the forensic complex of Roman Verona were found, in particular the remains of the curia.

The Sigurtà Garden Park began to take shape way back in 1407 and in 1941 Doctor Carlo Sigurtà, a pharmaceutical industrialist, went to Valeggio sul Mincio to buy a carriage. Here, he fell in love with a farm, bought it and, thanks also to the possibility of drawing water from the Mincio for irrigation, created this botanical paradise that was only later opened to the public.
